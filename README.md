# F022-Multiplex-Serology-Dashboard
A tool for generating output from Luminex Multiplex Serology. This was used in validation of a serological assay for *Treponema pallidum* (syphilis). 

This repo contains the project Andrew Lindsay did during his internship under [Dr. Tim Waterboer](https://www.dkfz.de/en/infections-cancer-epidemiology/index.php) with the Infections and Cancer Epidemiology group at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). Done from 09/01/2019 to 11/30/2019

## Abstract
  *Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum* (*T. pallidum)* is a pathogenic bacterium causing syphilis – asexually transmitted infection that affects millions people per year causing lesions on the skin, mucusmembranes, lymph nodes, and in rare cases, can affect the brain, heart and central nervous system, as well as create inflammation all over the body. To aid in investigating spread and severity of syphilis infections, we present the development and validation of *T. pallidum* Multiplex Serology. This methodology is ideally suited to large-scale population-based cohort studies due to its low-cost and high-throughput detection of protein antigens specific to *T. pallidum* – Tp15, Tp17, Tp44 and Tp47. These antigens recombinantly expressed and used with Multiplex Serology to assess serostatus for the pathogen. The assay was validated against sera with known serostatus from previous testing with the commercial assays SERODIA®-TP-PA IgG/IgM by Fijirebio (n = 129) and recomLine Treponema IgG,IgM by Mikrogen (n = 195). The sensitivity and specificity of the *T. pallidum* Multiplex Serology assays ranged from **94.7-99.3%** (median 97.7%) and **91.3-98.3%** (median 97.1%), respectively. High concordance to the reference assays was shown with kappa values of **0.87-0.96** (median kappa 0.95). Thus, developed assay for *T. pallidum* was shown to be a highly sensitive and specific serological assay designed for application to large prospective population-based cohort studies that will allow investigation into the prevalence of infection and investigate associations with the debilitating syphilis disease.
