# F022-Multiplex-Serology-Dashboard
A tool for generating output from Luminex Multiplex Serology. This was used in validation of a serological assay for Treponema pallidum (syphilis). 

This repo contains the project Andrew Lindsay did during his internship with the Infections and Cancer Epidemiology group at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). Done from 09/01/2019 to 11/30/2019

## Abstract
  Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum (T. pallidum) is a pathogenic bacterium causing syphilis – asexually transmitted infection that affects millions people per year causing lesions on the skin, mucusmembranes, lymph nodes, and in rare cases, can affect the brain, heart and central nervous system,as well as create inflammation all over the body. To aid in investigating spread and severity of syphilisinfections, we present the development and validation of T. pallidum Multiplex Serology. Thismethodology is ideally suited to large-scale population-based cohort studies due to its low-cost andhigh-throughput detection of protein antigens specific to T. pallidum – Tp15, Tp17, Tp44 and Tp47.These antigens recombinantly expressed and used with Multiplex Serology to assess serostatus forthe pathogen. The assay was validated against sera with known serostatus from previous testing withthe commercial assays SERODIA®-TP-PA IgG/IgM by Fijirebio (n = 129) and recomLine Treponema IgG,IgM by Mikrogen (n = 195). The sensitivity and specificity of the T. pallidum Multiplex Serology assaysranged from 94.7-99.3% (median 97.7%) and 91.3-98.3% (median 97.1%), respectively. Highconcordance to the reference assays was shown with kappa values of 0.87-0.96 (median kappa 0.95).Thus, developed assay was shown to be a highly sensitive and specific serological assay designed forapplication to large prospective population-based cohort studies that will allow investigation into theprevalence of infection and investigate associations with this debilitating disease.
